A game developed during my 3rd week at the Sparta training academy

## Intent

This was a project to put into practice the HTML, CSS and JS skills I'd been developing over the 2 weeks prior to this project, whilst expanding on them through my own research during development.

Furthermore it provided an introduction to basic Agile workflow, being done in two sprints.

In doing this project I aimed to cement my technical skills whilst developing my creativity to create a fun and functional product.

## Gameplay

At heart the game is a button mashing game with the aim of reaching your opponent at speed.

The game is introduced with a countdown timer which then permits players to act and charge at one another. Upon collision the game determines the winner based on its win conditions. This transitions to a victory screen with fanfare, offering the players a choice between playing again or returning to the main menu.

## Implementation

* jQuery 3.3.1
* Javascript
* HTML5
* CSS with Webkit interaction
* Responsive design fundamentals

## How to use?

Simply clone the repository to your machine or use this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tcsnr5fa71yvbdj/AAAtN92QVu3gjQPX-qV7tKN8a?dl=0) to a dropbox folder containing all of the necessary files. Ensure all folders are unzipped if using the latter method.

Then open the index.html file with your web browser and you should be up and running!

**_Happy Jousting!!_**
